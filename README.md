The first app is for players. It will be a way to create and keep character sheets on their device to play on the go.
The app will incorporate specific die rollers for all actions, plus some generic rollers for unanticipated events.

USER STORY:
"I need a Mazes & Minotaurs app that allows me to create, delete and choose between characters.  It should have an interactive character sheet that allows me to do all my rolls and checks. I need to be able to download and/or print my charcter sheet if needed. I need links to the Player Manual, and Companion pdf files, as well as a link to the M&M website. There should be a character Journal to record the adventures I have played withthat character, as well as an in-game notebook to record information during play. The app needs to be able to level my character up, and I want a "trphy screen" where I can check off the different monsters, gods, etc. that I slay/encounter/etc.
